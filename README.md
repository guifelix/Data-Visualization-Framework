# Data-Visualization-Framework
Personal project to create a framework where is possible to create data driven presentations.

To archieve that objective I'm using:

D3.js - https://d3js.org/ or https://github.com/d3/d3

RAW.js - http://raw.densitydesign.org/ or https://github.com/densitydesign/raw/ 
Strut or Builder4impress.js (builder for Impress.js) - https://github.com/tantaman/Strut, https://github.com/naugtur/builder4impress and https://github.com/impress/impress.js/ 
Cola.js - http://marvl.infotech.monash.edu/webcola/ or https://github.com/tgdwyer/WebCola 
Noflo.js - http://noflojs.org/ or https://github.com/noflo

The concept is to build a tool to create charts (with RAW and D3) and manage chart's flow and creation

Features:

  Grid of created charts
  Import data directly from CSV
